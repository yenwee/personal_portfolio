### Agent Architecture
```python
# Example of AiMod agent configuration
class DataPipelineAgent:
    def __init__(self, pipeline_config):
        self.langgraph_instance = LangGraph(config=pipeline_config)
        self.monitoring_tools = MonitoringStack()
        
    async def monitor_pipeline(self):
        """Continuous monitoring with intelligent intervention"""
        metrics = await self.get_pipeline_metrics()
        if self.detect_anomaly(metrics):
            return await self.execute_recovery_plan()
```
